In Next.js 13 and later with the App Router, a common pattern for structuring applications involves separating server-side and client-side logic within directories.

### Directory Structure

A typical directory structure for a route might look like this:

```
app/
├── your-route/
│   ├── page.tsx       # Server-side rendering and data fetching
│   ├── loading.tsx    # Custom loading UI (Server Component)
│   └── content.tsx    # Client-side interactivity (Client Component)
```

### `page.tsx`

*   **Purpose:** This file is the entry point for a route segment. It's primarily used for **server-side logic**, including data fetching.
*   **Execution:** By default, components in `page.tsx` are React Server Components, meaning they are rendered on the server.
*   **Data Fetching:** You can perform asynchronous data fetching directly within `page.tsx` components using `async/await`.
*   **Rendering:** The HTML generated by `page.tsx` is sent to the client.

### `loading.tsx`

*   **Purpose:** This optional file allows you to display a custom loading UI while the server is fetching data or rendering the initial `page.tsx`.
*   **Execution:** `loading.tsx` is a Server Component.
*   **Behavior:** Next.js automatically wraps `page.tsx` and any nested layouts in a Suspense boundary when a `loading.tsx` file is present. The `loading.tsx` component is rendered immediately on the server and shown to the user while the data for `page.tsx` is being fetched.

### `content.tsx`

*   **Purpose:** This file is used to encapsulate **client-side interactivity**. Components that require browser APIs, state management, or event handlers should be defined here.
*   **Execution:** Components in `content.tsx` should be marked as Client Components using the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file.
*   **Integration:** `content.tsx` is typically imported and rendered within `page.tsx`.

### Pattern for Dynamic Routes

For dynamic routes (e.g., `app/products/[id]`), the pattern is similar. The dynamic segment is represented by square brackets `[]`.

```
app/
├── products/
│   └── [id]/
│       ├── page.tsx       # Server-side logic for a specific product
│       ├── loading.tsx    # Loading state for a specific product
│       └── content.tsx    # Client-side interactivity for a specific product
```

In this case, `page.tsx` would access the dynamic route parameters (e.g., `id`) to fetch data specific to that product on the server. `loading.tsx` would display a loading state while the product data is fetched, and `content.tsx` would contain any interactive elements related to displaying the product details.

### Summary

This separation of concerns helps improve performance by rendering as much as possible on the server, reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client. `page.tsx` handles the initial server rendering and data fetching, `loading.tsx` provides a user-friendly loading experience, and `content.tsx` is reserved for components that require client-side capabilities. For dynamic routes, the same pattern applies within the dynamic segment directory.
